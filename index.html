<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hi! I am a PhD student at Freie Universit√§t Berlin broadly interested in
interactions between algebraic geometry and combinatorics.
I started my PhD in
September 2024 under the supervision of Christian Haase and
Leonid Monin (from EPFL). My thesis revolves around studying hyperplane
arrangements, wonderful compactifications, matroids and toric varieties.
My goal is to find some interesting combinatorial interpretations
for certain geometric quantities.</p>

<p>Before starting my PhD I studied at EPFL, where I obtained both my Bachelor's
    and Master's degrees. During my Master's thesis 
    I was working with tropical linear series. I studied their structure and the
    question of realizability. You can download the manuscript
