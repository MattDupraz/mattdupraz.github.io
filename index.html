<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hi! I am a PhD student at Freie Universität Berlin broadly interested in
interactions between algebraic geometry and combinatorics.
I started my PhD in
September 2024 under the supervision of Christian Haase (FU Berlin) and
Leonid Monin (EPFL). My current interests revolve around hyperplane
arrangements, wonderful compactifications, matroids and toric varieties.
My goal is to find some interesting combinatorial interpretations
for certain geometric quantities. More precisely, I have been trying to find an
Ehrhart theoretic interpretation (in terms of some lattice counts) of the Euler
characteristic of a divisor on a non-complete toric variety. I have also been
thinking about an abstract combinatorial framework encoding the K-theory of
toric varieties.</p>

<p>During my Master's thesis at EPFL, I studied tropical curves,
    continuous chip firing games and tropical linear systems. I studied their
    structure and topology of tropical linear systems and the question of
    realizability of tropical divisors. You can download the manuscript
    <a class="text-link" href="/assets/documents/master_thesis.pdf">
        here</a>.
    I am still actively thinking about these topics, so do not hestitate to
    reach out if this also interests you.
</p>
