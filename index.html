<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hi! I am a PhD student at Freie Universität Berlin broadly interested in
interactions between algebraic geometry and combinatorics.
I started my PhD in
September 2024 under the supervision of Christian Haase (FU Berlin) and
Leonid Monin (EPFL), in a project titled "K-Theory and Normal Complexes".
The goal of this project is to study Chow rings and K-rings of certain toric
varieties, with the aim of finding interesting combinatorial interpretations of
some computations in these rings.<br>

More generally, I am interested in algebraic combinatorics. For example the
various interactions between objects such as matroids, hyperplane arrangements,
polytopes and objects from algebraic geometry.<br>

I am also interested in tropical geometry. I wrote my Master's thesis at EPFL
on the topic of tropical curves,
continuous chip firing games and tropical linear systems. I studied the
structure and topology of tropical linear systems and the question of
realizability of tropical divisors.
